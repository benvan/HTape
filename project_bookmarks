NOTES: VERY RELEVANT. Binaural simulation of complex acoustic scenes for interactive audio. "We describe a computationally efficient spatial reverberation and 3-D positional audio mixing architecture for real-time virtual acoustics using headphones or loudspeakers. A new method for binaural synthesis of massive numbers of sound sources is introduced. Extensions of the processing architecture are described for modeling spatially extended sound events, simulating near-field emitters, rendering multi-room reverberation and incorporating the perceptually salient features of early reflections and acoustic obstructions in the listener's immediate virtual environment. The proposed approach enables the implementation of scalable interactive 3D audio rendering systems in personal computers, game consoles, set top boxes or mobile phones. The associated scene representation model is compatible with current interactive audio standards, including OpenAL, MPEG-4 and JSR-234."

URL: http://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/jreality/index.php?article_id=29
NOTES: Scary. Jreality, not tested yet. Quote: jReality supports spatialized audio. Various sound sources (e.g., audio files or software synthesizers) can be placed in the 3D scene. The audio can then be rendered on a wide range of speaker setups including stereo, 5.1 surround, and arbitrary Ambisonics rigs. The audio rendering pipeline of jReality includes a physically accurate simulation of sound propagation that implicitly creates Doppler effects, as well as support for effects such as reverberation and distance cues.
