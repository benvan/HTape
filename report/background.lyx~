Sound localisation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sound localisation is a term which describes the ability for a listener
 to approximate the direction and distance of a perceived sound.
 Human beings make use of several auditory cues in this evaluation, including
 spectral information, interaural time difference (ITD) and interaural level
 difference (ILD).
 We characterise the location of a sound in 3D space by three quantities:
 its azimuth angle, its elevation angle and its distance from the listener
 (see Figure 1).
 While the exact mechanisms by which our brains evaluate these parameters
 is yet unknown, we are familiar with which audio cues are required.
 Interaural time differences exist because sound propagates at a finite
 speed.
 Sound emanating from the left will reach the left ear before it reaches
 the right, and due to sound's relatively low propagation speed through
 air, we are able to detect this.
 Interaural level differences occur primarly because the head shadows the
 furthest ear from the sound source.
 Depending on the frequency of the sound, signal dissipation in air may
 also play a detectable role in ILDs.

ITD, ILD and the locus of possibilities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By considering only the ITD between left and right ears, it is possible
 to confine the potential location of a sound to the surface of a cone,
 emanating laterally from the listener's head.
 This cone, called the

, describes all the points in space from which a sound would produce the
 detected ITD.
 In his pioneering forray into the mechanics of sound localisation, Hans
 Wallach concluded that since we are able to localise in the median plane
 (the plane passing vertically through the skull, dividing the head exactly
 into left and right sides), another factor must exist.
